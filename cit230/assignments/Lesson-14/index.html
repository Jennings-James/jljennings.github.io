                    <h3>LOCAL MAN COMPETS IN MAJOR RACE</h3>
                    <P>On June 29th thru the 31st the city of San Diego California held its annual Bike the Beach event. The courses take riders on a grand tour of the area starting on Point Loma near the Cabrillo National Monument. The route winds its way past the San Diego Zoo, then on to El Cajon before heading north to Escondido. After reaching Oceanside the route turns south and heads back to San Diego. The event lasts three days and is very fast paced with many twists and turns. Bozeman’s own “Fast” Freddy Flintstone finished a very impressive 3rd against the mostly pro field. Freddy rides a (insert bike model) carefully maintained and tuned by the expert technicians here at The Mountain Spoke.</P>
                    <h2>Congratulations “Fast” Freddy!!</h2>
