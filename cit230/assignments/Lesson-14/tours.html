            <h3>Adventure awaits on our mountain tours!</h3>
                <P>The Big Mountain adventure is our most challenging tour we leave from the Dogwood Trail, trail head and wind or way up the steep terrane to the highest point on the trail just over 9000ft. The tour takes a lunch break at this point in preparation for the down hill run. The round trip covers 16.5 miles with about 7 miles being uphill. This is a ride for the most skilled and experienced riders. You must wear a helmet, knee and elbow pads are highly recommended.</P>
                <p>The Little mountain tour has two options the first leaves from the Cat Hollow Trail, trail head and makes an exciting climb to the top of Little Mountain overlook. After a lunch break we begin the exciting decent which takes back the trail head. The second option is to take the shuttle from our store up to Little Mountain overlook and take the exciting down hill ride back to the trail head where the shuttle will pick you up. This tour is for intermediate riders with some experience in downhill riding. You must wear a helmet, knee and elbow pads are highly recommended.</p>
                <p>Our third mountain bike adventure is a relaxing ride along the Low Land Trail. We leave from the trail head and ride the entire length of the 12-mile loop. Most of the ride is flat or near flat and features beautiful views of the area. This is a beginner tour and is perfect for the family. You must wear a helmet, knee and elbow pads are highly recommended.</p>
